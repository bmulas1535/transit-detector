## Project notebook

To use this notebook, you will need to download the training and test data.
That data can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RGJNoM2-wKCJFr_9jBaquemj9p3T9QsV)

Once you've downloaded the `.csv` file, you will need to change the `DATA_PATH` variable in the notebook to match the location of the parent folder for the `.csv` file
